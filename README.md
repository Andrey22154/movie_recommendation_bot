#Movie Recommendation Telegram Bot

Overview

This project features a Telegram bot that recommends movies based on user preferences. It leverages a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze and suggest films that align closely with the user's taste.

Features
Movie Search: Users can search for movies by title.
Duplicate Handling: In cases where multiple movies share the same title, the bot prompts the user to specify the release year for accuracy.
Recommendations: Based on the selected movie, the bot suggests similar movies using a cosine similarity measure on various movie attributes.
Interactive Responses: The bot provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for movie enthusiasts.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing Machine Learning algorithms.
Telegram Bot API: For creating and managing the bot.
How It Works
Data Processing: The bot processes a dataset of movies, analyzing attributes like genre, ratings, and release year.
User Interaction: When a user sends a movie title, the bot checks for duplicates and asks for the release year if necessary.
Movie Matching: After identifying the correct movie, the bot uses cosine similarity to find and suggest similar movies.
